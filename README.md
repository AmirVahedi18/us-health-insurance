https://github.com/AmirVahedi18/us-health-insurance/blob/master/README.md

## Results:
At the end of this analysis, ``XGBoost`` and ``Random Forest`` regressors obtained the best result among other regressors such as ``linear regressor``, ``decision tree``, and ``support vector machine``. The final ``RMSE`` on random forest on test set after fine-tuning is 4527 and the same result for XGBoost is 4513.
